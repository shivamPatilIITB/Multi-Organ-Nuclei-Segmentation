The term MoNuSeg mentioned in the assignment pdf stands for Multi Organ Nuclei Segmentation

**Resume points:**

Multi Organ Nuclei Segmentation using U-Net | Image Processing

Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Oct’22 - Nov’22)

(a) Implemented a U-Net for binary semantic segmentation in tensorflow with keras for nucleus and non-nucleus segmentation for tissue images

(b) Trained and validated the U-Net using dice loss and modified the baseline architecture by using a 
combination of dice loss and MS-SSIM as loss function with a trade-off parameter

**Explanation for above points:**

For (a) please refer the section: "Question 2 Code a basic UNet for semantic segmentation using Keras for binary nucleus vs non-nucleus segmentation." 
In the above Google colab notebook. Observations are mentioned below it.

For (b) please refer the section: "Question 5(c) Changing the loss function as a combination of Dice and MS-SSIM with a tradeoff parameter." In the colab notebook.  
Observations are mentioned below it.

Training using dice loss in (b) please refer the section: "Question 3 Train a UNet using Dice loss and show Dice Score on validation data." In the colab notebook.
